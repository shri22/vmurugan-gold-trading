1 OVERVIEW
This document describes the steps for technical integration process between merchant website /
application and Payment-Gateway.
Through Payment-Gateway, your customers can make electronic payments through various payment
modes such as:
• Credit cards
• Debit cards
• Net banking
• EMI
• Cash Cards/Wallets
• Mobile/web invoicing
• Integrated NEFT/RTGS
• Bank deposits
• Standing instruction on cards
• Customer account direct debit (e-NACH)
• UPI - Collect and Intent based
• BharatQR
• E-Collect
Payment-Gateway also offers you a web portal where you have access to all your prior
transaction/payment details, settlement details, analytics, etc. You can also use this portal to create
invoices singly or in bulk, set reminders, recurring billing, and many more features, manage your
payables, vendor payments, set split ratios for vendor payments, process refunds, etc. Ask PaymentGateway for management portal.
Following information will be required from Payment-Gateway for proceeding with integration, this
information will be available in management portal.
{pg_api_url} This is the domain url od Payment-Gateway APIs
api_key This is the key required for api access
salt This is like password to access APIs and used in HASH/CHECKSUM calculations in
request and responses. (Keep it safely do not share it publicly)
encryption key This is encryption key used in Payment request to encrypted the request data
(Keep it safely do not share it publicly)
decryption_key This is decryption key used for decrypting the payment response returned on
return_url (Keep it safely do not share it publicly)

2 PAYMENT REQUEST API
When you integrate with Payment-Gateway, the customer will be re -directed from your merchant
website to the Payment-Gateway payment page. After completion of the transaction, Payment-Gateway
will direct the customer back to the merchant website
URL: https://{pg_api_url}/v2/paymentrequest
Method: POST
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
2.1 Steps for Integration
• You need to submit a POST REQUEST to our server, at the above-mentioned URL; Note that it
should be a html form to be able to redirect to payment page e.g. <form method='post'
action=' https://{pg_api_url}/v2/paymentseamlessrequest '> </form>
Note: hash is a mandatory parameter. If your hash is not properly calculated or does not match
for whatever reason, we will not be able to process the payment. The usage of hash is explained
in subsequent sections.
• When you call this API, the customer is necessarily re-directed to Payment-Gateway’s payment
page. After the customer makes the payment through Payment-Gateway (entering his card
details or netbanking details etc.), we direct the customer back to your merchant site.
Note: If you need the customer to enter credit card details on your (merchant) website and
would NOT want us to redirect to the Payment-Gateway page, we can get that done, provided
you are PCI-DSS certified. If you are not certified and would like to get certified, let us know. We
will guide you appropriately on how to get it done.
• We recommend that you check the hash at your end again, after we send back the response to
you. This is essential to prevent user data tampering fraud.
• Transaction ID and order ID:
• When you submit your transaction request to Payment-Gateway, you need to submit an
order ID as part of the request. This order ID can be used by you as a universal reference
number for all transaction requests submitted by you.
• When your customer clicks the "Pay" button on the payment page, a unique transaction
ID is assigned to the transaction.
• Order ID acts as a "merchant reference number". You must maintain uniqueness of your
order IDs.

tax_on_tdr_amount This is the Tax (GST) charged on the TDR Amount **
amount_orig This is the amount requested by merchant **.
Typically, this will be same as the amount field, but in case of customer
surcharge model this will be a different value. 
9
cardmasked Masked card number which was used to make the transaction **. For
example, 437748******0069
emi_tenure This field is returned if "send_emi_details" merchant param is enabled and/or
in payment request emi_info param is set to get this in response
emi_rate_of_interest This field is returned if "send_emi_details" merchant param is enabled and/or
in payment request emi_info param is set to get this in response
hash Payment-Gateway calculates the hash using the same algorithm which was
outlined earlier. Hence, the merchant needs to check whether this returned
hash matches the calculated hash.
** Note: This parameter will be returned as part of the response only if the merchant’s account has
been enabled for the same. Please speak to your Payment-Gateway relationship manager if you would
like this information to be returned in response.
Note: It is important to validate the hash after you receive the response from Payment-Gateway. A
failed response sent from Payment-Gateway server to your server via browser could be tampered by a
malicious end-user and turned into “success”. To make sure the transaction response is the same as
what Payment-Gateway server sent please check the hash before considering the transaction response
as final.
Note: Format of transaction ID is as follows: HDVISC1299876438". The 3rd to 6th digits (both inclusive) in
the transaction ID signify the "bankcode". This information is enough to obtain the payment method and
payment channel. A list of bankcodes and corresponding payment mode/channel is available in
Appendix 3 of this document.

3 ENCRYPTING / DECRYPTING PAYMENT REQUEST API
• This section focuses on encrypting a payment request that we built in previous section
• For encrypting and decrypting payment request, encryption and decryption keys will be
provided by Payment-Gateway.
• Payment request is encrypted using AES-265-CBC algorithm with encryption key and then
posted to payment-gateway as explained in following sections.
• Payment-Gateway will post the final response of the transaction in encrypted format on the
return_url provided in the request, this response needs to be decrypted using the decryption
key as described in following sections and then processed further.
3.1 Parameters to be POSTed in Encrypted Payment Request
URL: https://{pg_api_url}/v2/paymentrequest
Method: POST
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Parameter Name Description Data type Optional /
Mandatory
api_key Payment-Gateway would assign a unique
40-digit merchant key to you. This key is
exclusive to your business/login account.
If you have multiple login accounts, there
will necessarily be one different api_key
per login account that is assigned to you.
varchar(40) mandatory
encrypted_data This field will contain encrypted data
(Following section explains how to
prepare data and then encrypt it.)
varchar(5000) mandatory
iv This field will contain initial vector that is
used for encryption, it must be 16 byte
long cryptographically secure random
string.
varchar(16) mandatory
1. Preparation of data: - First you need to create JSON formatted data and then encrypt the JSON
string. Following is the structure of JSON. Details of each field is same as defined in payment
request in previous section.
{
 "api_key": "f14e50fd-82f0-4ce0-bd4e-de924908d4ff",

 "return_url": "https://yoursite.com/return_page_success.php",
 "return_url_failure": "https://yoursite.com/return_page_failure.php",
 "return_url_cancel": "https://yoursite.com/return_page_success.php",
 "state": "Karnataka",
 "udf1": "Users Defined Value",
"udf2": "",
 "udf3": "",
 "udf4": "",
 "udf5": "",
 "zip_code": "560001",
 "hash":
"23CD8F59DB509F55951CE74C922879128098F4998C72BFD7400011C6B305290DD9333101C1C
C70CEB04587C49E6949AA864F83D54088F691FD57C7222CDB2572"
}
2. Encrypting the JSON data: - After encrypting the json data above result will be passed in
encrypted_data and iv fields, to encrypt we use 256-bit AES encryption, encryption method is
AES-256-CBC, encrypted data should be base64 encoded before posting. Encryption key will be
provided by Payment-Gateway. Note that both encrypted_data and iv are base64 encoded, if
not already done (some encryption libraries do not base 64 encode the resulting encryption and
the randomly generated iv bytes)
Sample encryption code in PHP is provided below for your reference. you can easily get libraries in other
languages (.NET, JAVA, Nodejs) to do AES-256-CBC encryption and base64 encoding
/**
* AES-256-CBC Encryption method, First it encrypts the data and then encodes it to
base64
* @param string $plain_data Plain text Data to be encrypted
* @param string $encryption_key Provided by Payment Gateway
* @return array
*/
12
function encryptData($plain_data, $encryption_key)
{
 $iv = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(16); //random 16 byte/char long string or unixtimestamp(10chars)+random-string(6chars) time().mt_rand(100000, 999999)
 $encrypted = openssl_encrypt($plain_data, "AES-256-CBC", $encryption_key,
OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, $iv);
 return [base64_encode($encrypted), base64_encode($iv)];
}
Following is sample HTML form to post data and redirect to payment page.
<form action="https://{pg_api_url}/v2/paymentrequest" method="post">
<input type="hidden" value="<?php echo $post_values['api_key']; ?>"
name="api_key"/>
<input type="hidden" value="<?php echo $encrypted_data; ?>"
name="encrypted_data"/>
<input type="hidden" value="<?php echo $iv; ?>" name="iv"/>
<!-- Generally instead of showing the submit button do an auto submit using
javascript onload="document.forms[0].submit()" -->
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
3.2 Decryption of Response Parameters returned
In the response, you will receive AES-256-CBC encrypted data which needs to be decrypted. Following
sections explains how to decrypt the encrypted data.
Parameter Name Description
api_key Payment-Gateway would assign a unique 36-digit merchant key to
you. This key is exclusive to your business/login account. If you have
multiple login accounts, there will necessarily be one different api_key
per login account that is assigned to you.
encrypted_data This field will contain encrypted data (Following section explains how
to decrypt and get the response data.)
iv This field will contain initial vector use this to decrypt the
encrypted_data received in response
Decrypting the encrypted data: - To decrypt we use 256 bit AES encryption algorithm, decryption
method is AES-256-CBC, decrypted data should be base64 decoded before using. Decrypted data will be
in JSON format as shown below. Decryption key will be provided by Payment-Gateway.
Sample decryption code in PHP, you can easily get libraries in other languages (.NET, JAVA, Nodejs) to do
AES-256-CBC decryption and base64 decoding.
/**
* AES-256-CBC Decryption method, First it decodes base64 encoded encrypted data and
* then decrypts it to get JSON data string
*
13
* @param String $encrypted_data Encrypted data received in response
* @param String $decryption_key Provided by Payment Gateway
* @param String $iv Initial Vector iv as received in response
*/
function decryptData($encrypted_data, $decryption_key, $iv)
{
 return openssl_decrypt(base64_decode($encrypted_data), 'AES-256-CBC',
$decryption_key, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, base64_decode($iv));
}
JSON response after decryption will be as following, .

4 GET PAYMENT REQUEST URL (Two Step Integration)
Payment-Gateway provides an API which returns a unique payment page URL on your merchant server
in response which can be used in any browser to show the payment selection page and complete the
transaction. This process gets complete in two steps.
URL: https://{pg_api_url}/v2/getpaymentrequesturl
4.1 Steps for Integration
• First step is, you need to submit a POST REQUEST to API URL
Note: hash is a mandatory parameter. If your hash is not properly calculated or does not match
for whatever reason, we will not be able to process the payment. The usage of hash is explained
in subsequent sections.
• In response you will get a payment execution URL. Following is the sample response message in
case of success.
 {
 "data": {
 "url": "https://{pg_api_url}/v2/executepaymentrequesturl/3c1943aa-13be-4866-925ed56c32c62d47",
 "uuid": "3c1943aa-13be-4866-925e-d56c32c62d47",
 "expiry_datetime": "2019-06-14 16:38:36",
 "order_id": "T103"
 }
}
• The response message apart from payment URL will contain a UUID (unique identification
number for this transaction request), expiry date/time (this url will not work after the given
expiry date/time) and order id (the one sent in the request by merchant). For every get payment
URL request a unique UUID is generated in response.
• Second step is after getting the URL, open it in any browser or app webview for showing the
payment method selection page to customer to complete the payment.
It is best to use this API if payments are going to be done through mobile apps for preventing frauds or
hash / data tampering. The request can be built on your server and the unique URL can be sent to Client
app, from where the payment process would continue.
15
4.2 Parameters to be posted in request
URL: https://{pg_api_url}/v2/getpaymentrequesturl
Parameters to be posted for this API are exactly same as in v2/paymentrequest API (see Section 2.2),
except for one additional optional parameter for defining the url expiry in minutes
Parameter Name Description Data type Optional /
Mandatory
expiry_in_minutes This field is to define the response url
expiry in minutes. This field excepts
integer value minimum of 15 (15
minutes) and maximum of 10080 (7 days)
varchar(10) optional
4.3 Successful Response Parameters returned
Parameter
Name Description
url Payment URL, which can open in any browser
expiry_datetime The Payment URL expiration time, by default set for 15 mins
uuid Unique ID generated for every request
order_id
This is your (merchant) reference number which you submitted while making the original
transaction.
4.4 Manually Expire a Payment Request URL
This API is used if the links created by getpaymentrequesturl API needs to be expired before it
automatically expires as per expiry_in_minutes. After this API is successfully run then user prevented
from making a transaction on calling /v2/executepaymentrequesturl/{uuid} URL
URL: https://{pg_api_url}/v2/expirepaymentrequesturl
Parameter Name Description Data type Optional /
Mandatory
api_key Payment-Gateway would assign a unique
36-digit merchant key to you. This key is
exclusive to your business/login account.
If you have multiple login accounts, there
will necessarily be one different api_key
per login account that is assigned to you.
varchar(36) Mandatory
16
uuid This is the uuid returned by the
getpaymentrequesturl api
varchar(40) mandatory
hash You need to compute a hash of all your
parameters and pass that hash to
Payment-Gateway, for details about
calculating hash refer Appendix 2.
Note: the SALT will be provided by
Payment-Gateway separately. NEVER
PASS SALT IN A FORM, DO NOT STORE
SALT IN ANDROID APP APK or IPHONE
APP package
varchar(255) mandatory
The expire payment request url parameter will be in jquery format as shown below:
form.append("api_key", "f14e50fd-82f0-4ce0-bd4e-de234sffd4ff");
form.append("uuid", "3c1943aa-13be-4866-925e-d56c32c62d47");
form.append("hash", "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA77AAABCSDKANSKAKSBFKKASKAKS");
On successful call to this API the response posted in jquery format will be as shown below:
{
 "data": {
 "code": "SUCCESS",
 "message": "The URL is expired",
 }
}
If the transaction is already in progress, the API will return an error message
{
{
 "error": {
 "code": “TRANSACTION-IN-PROGRESS”,
 "message": " Your request cannot be processed"
 }
}
17
5 FETCH INTENT URL PAYMENT REQUEST
Payment Gateway will provide an API which returns a unique payment page URL on your merchant
server in response which can be used in any browser to show the payment selection page and complete
the transaction. This process gets complete in two steps.
URL: https://{pg_api_url}/v2/getpaymentrequestintenturl
5.1 Steps for Integration
• First step is, you need to submit a POST REQUEST to API URL
• In response you will get a payment intent URL. Following is the sample response message in
case of success.
{
"data": {
"upi_intent_url":
"upi:\/\/pay?pa=MERCUAT@bank&pn=Karmendra+Biz&am=13.45&mam=13.45&tr=6478789&tn=P
ayment+for+6478789&mc=5021&mode=04&purpose=00&utm_campaign=DEBIT&utm_medium=
PAYFAIRUAT&utm_source=6478789",
"payment_request_id": 6478789,
“order_id” : 123456
}
}
• The response message contains the intent url, transaction id and order id sent in the payment
request.
• Second step is after getting the URL is to use trigger an app from the respective mobile device.
It is best to use this API if payments are going to be done through mobile payment apps for preventing
frauds or hash / data tampering.
18
6 PAYMENT STATUS API
Payment-Gateway provides an API which you can use to check the status of any prior transaction. You
can use this to reconcile transactions. We strongly recommend that you make it a practice to use this for
every transaction that was made. This serves two purposes:
• The response might not reach you due to network issues or other problems such as user clicking
refresh button on their browser, etc.
• This also protects against any tampering, since you have a second fallback check here.
Payment-Gateway offers a sophisticated API wherein you can apply "filters" on the resultset you want to
retrieve. You can search our system by the transaction ID, or the order ID, or even by parameters such as
date range, customer phone number, etc. You can also pass in various combinations of these parameters
to get the resultset of your choice.
Note: Your designated server IP will need to be whitelisted by Payment-Gateway for this API to work. If
you receive errors such as "Unauthorized" while accessing this API, please contact your Payment-Gateway
relationship manager to get this fixed.
URL: https://{pg_api_url}/v2/paymentstatus
6.1 Parameters to be POSTed
Parameter Name Description Data type Optional /
Mandatory
api_key Payment-Gateway would assign a unique
36-digit merchant key to you. This key is
exclusive to your business/login account. If
you have multiple login accounts, there will
necessarily be one different api_key per
login account that is assigned to you.

}
In such cases where result set is expected to have status of more than 50 transactions, it is required to
use pagination.
Pagination allows to access data in smaller chunks making it easier for server to return data quickly.
To allow for pagination one need to pass following additional parameter in request
Parameter Name Description Data type Optional /
Mandatory
page_number Page number you need to retrieve, its value is
limited by information received in the first
response that is received
integer optional
per_page Number to records need to see per page, this
value should be between 1 and 50
integer optional
If above parameters are passed, response will have additional information about pagination as following
"page": {
 "total": 175,
 "per_page": 10,
23
 "current_page": 1,
 "last_page": 18,
 "from": 1,
 "to": 10
 },
This pagination information should be used in page_number filed for subsequent api request.

7 REFUNDS APIs
Payment-Gateway provides a refund API which merchants can use to programmatically issue refunds
instead of clicking the "refund" button in the Payment-Gateway UI. This API can be invoked on any prior
successful transaction. The transaction which is being refunded should be in either "paid" or "settled"
state, or in "refunded" state (in case of partial amount refunds). Refunds can be either for the full
amount paid by the customer, or any part of it.
The API needs a valid transaction ID as input.
Note: processing of refunds is subject to availability of funds in subsequent settlement cycles. This API
will return a failure response in case sufficient funds are not available to process the refund.
7.1 Refund request API
URL: https://{pg_api_url}/v2/refundrequest

NOT using this filed then be careful, as
each request will be treated as a new
refund request. Thus it is
recommended to use this field.
varchar(30) Optional
25
merchant_order_id This is your (merchant) reference
number which you submitted while
making the original transaction. Note
that if this value does not match with
related transaction_id field then you

varchar(30) Optional
amount The amount which needs to be
refunded. This needs to be less than or
equal to the transaction amount.
decimal(10,2) Mandatory
description Description of the refund. Usually the
reason for issuing refund, as specified

10 SETTLEMENT APIs
10.1 Get Settlements API
URL: https://{pg_api_url}/v2/getsettlements
This API allows a merchant to programmatically access the status of any of his past settlements and
other pertinent information pertaining to a prior settlement. If this API returns a blank
bank_reference_number, it means the amount is not yet settled. If the API returns no data, it means
that the system has not calculated settlements yet, you would need to re-check after 12:30 AM.

13 SEAMLESS PAYMENT REQUEST API
In case you perform the normal payment integration process as outlined earlier in the document, the
customer will necessarily be redirected to the Payment-Gateway payment page wherein he will be
required to enter his card details or select the appropriate bank/payment instrument (such as wallets
etc.) with which he would like to make the payment.
If you would like your customer to perform the bank selection and/or enter his card information on your
site, without using the Payment-Gateway payment page, this can be achieved using the seamless
payment request API. Payment-Gateway would provide you a list of appropriate bankcodes which you
would be required to pass along with the payment request. These bankcodes are available in Appendix 3
of this document.
Please note that in order to use our seamless payment request API you would need to be PCI-DSS
compliant. For more information on PCI compliance, or if you would like us to assist you in your PCI
compliance efforts, please contact your Payment-Gateway relationship manager.
13.1 Steps for Integration
• You need to submit a POST REQUEST to our server, at the below-mentioned URL; Note that it
should be a html form to be able to redirect to payment page e.g. <form method='post'
action=' https://{pg_api_url}/v2/paymentseamlessrequest '> </form>
•
• Note: hash is a mandatory parameter. If your hash is not properly calculated or does not match
for whatever reason, we will not be able to process the payment. The usage of hash is explained
in subsequent sections.
• When you submit your transaction request to Payment-Gateway, we assign a transaction ID to
you.
• The customer is automatically redirected to the appropriate bank or 3D-secure page, as the case
may be.
• After the customer pays the entire amount using one or more payment instruments, he is
redirected back to the merchant site.
• We recommend that you check the hash at your end again, after we send back the response to
you. This is essential to prevent user data tampering fraud.

Payment-Gateway
53
15 APPENDIX 2 - Hash calculation guide
15.1 How to Calculate Hash on API request
To calculate hash, you will need the salt provided by Payment-Gateway.
15.1.1 Hashing generation algorithm
Following are the steps to calculate hash.
1. Create a | (pipe) delimited string called hash_data with first value as the salt.
2. Now sort the post fields based on their keys and create a | delimited string, for the fields with
values.
3. Hash the hash_data string using SHA512 hashing algorithm and save the hash in secure_hash
string
4. Convert the secure_hash string to upper case
15.1.1.1 Example PHP code to generate hash
/**
* @param array $parameters
* @param string $salt
* @param string $hashing_method
* @return null|string
*/
function generateHashKey($parameters, $salt, $hashing_method = 'sha512')
{
 $secure_hash = null;
 ksort($parameters);
 $hash_data = $salt;
 foreach ($parameters as $key => $value) {
 if (strlen($value) > 0) {
 $hash_data .= '|' . trim($value);
 }
 }
 if (strlen($hash_data) > 0) {
 $secure_hash = strtoupper(hash($hashing_method, $hash_data));
 }
 return $secure_hash;
}
15.2 How to check the response Hash
It is important to make sure the response received from Payment-Gateway is genuine, and to do so you
will need to do a hash check on your server on receiving the response.
54
Every response received has a field called hash. Sometimes it is null, which means it in not important to
check hash for the response, but if there is a hash present please perform hash check as described
below and make sure integrity of the response received from Payment-Gateway APIs.
To check hash, you will need the salt provided by Payment-Gateway.
15.2.1 Hash checking algorithm
15.2.1.1 Example PHP code to check hash
/**
* @param string $salt
* @param array $response_array
* @return bool
*/
function responseHashCheck($salt, $response_array)
{
 /* If hash field is null no need to check hash for such response */
 if (is_null($response_array['hash'])) {
 return true;
 }
 $response_hash = $response_array['hash'];
 unset($response_array['hash']);
 /* Now we have response json without the hash */
 $calculated_hash = hashCalculate($salt, $response_array);
 return ($response_hash == $calculated_hash) ? true : false;
}
/**
* @param string $salt
* @param array $input
* @return string
*/
function hashCalculate($salt, $input)
{
 /* Columns used for hash calculation, Donot add or remove values from $hash_columns
array */
 $hash_columns = array_keys($input);
 /*Sort the array before hashing*/
 sort($hash_columns);
 /*Create a | (pipe) separated string of all the $input values which are available
in $hash_columns*/
 $hash_data = $salt;
 foreach ($hash_columns as $column) {
 if (isset($input[$column])) {
 if (strlen($input[$column]) > 0) {
 $hash_data .= '|' . trim($input[$column]);
 }
 }
 }
 $hash = strtoupper(hash("sha512", $hash_data));
55
 return $hash;
}
15.2.1.2 Example PHP code to check hash if response is JSON
/**
* @param $salt
* @param $response_json
* @return bool
*/
function responseHashCheck($salt, $response_array)
{
 /* If hash field is null no need to check hash for such response */
 if (is_null($response_array['hash'])) {
 return true;
 }
 $response_hash = $response_array['hash'];
 unset($response_array['hash']);
 $response_json = json_encode($response_array, JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES);
 /* Now we have response json without the hash */
 $calculated_hash = hashCalculate($salt, $response_json);
 return ($response_hash == $calculated_hash) ? true : false;
}
/**
* @param $salt
* @param $input_json
* @return string
*/
function hashCalculate($salt, $input_json)
{
 /* Prepend salt with input json and calculate the hash using SHA512 */
 $hash_data = $salt . $input_json;
 $hash = strtoupper(hash('sha512', $hash_data));
 return $hash;
}
