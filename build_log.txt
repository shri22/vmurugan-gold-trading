Running Gradle task 'assembleRelease'...                        
Your project is configured with Android NDK 27.0.12077973, but the following plugin(s) depend on a different Android NDK version:
- integration_test requires Android NDK 28.2.13676358
Fix this issue by using the highest Android NDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to /Users/admin/Documents/Win-Projects/AntiGravity/vmurugan-gold-trading/android/app/build.gradle.kts:

    android {
        ndkVersion = "28.2.13676358"
        ...
    }
